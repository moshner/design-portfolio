# Portfolio

Hi, my name is Nick Mosher. I'm a Senior User Experience Designer, husband, and father. Here I have collected a small sample of my work as a designer, researcher, futurist, and innovator. Let me know if you have any questions: nick@mosher.me.

This portfolio will highlight each stage of my design process. However, I understand that each project is unique and requires its own process customized to its individual needs. I hope to introduce you to my thoughts about each stage as well as provide an example artifact.
